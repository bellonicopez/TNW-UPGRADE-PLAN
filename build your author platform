Based on your established author profile as a thoughtful futurist and the unique, philosophical nature of The Neural Wars, our strategy is not to shout "buy my book." It is to become an essential voice in the conversations your book is a part of.

Here is a comprehensive, actionable plan to build your author platform and make you appealing for launch.

The Core Strategy: Become the Thought Leader, Not the Salesman
Your greatest asset is the intellectual and emotional depth of your work. We will leverage this by positioning you as a knowledgeable and insightful commentator on the very topics your books explore: AI ethics, consciousness, the future of humanity, and digital identity.

Phase 1: Foundation (The Next 7 Days)
This is about setting up your professional digital footprint.

Author Website/Landing Page:

Action: Secure a simple domain (e.g., bellonicopez.com or theneuralwars.com). Create a one-page website.
Content Must-Haves:
The Series Tagline: "Humanity's next evolution must be chosen."
A Compelling Synopsis: Use the refined, soul-focused descriptions we developed.
Striking Cover Art: Prominently displayed.
Your Author Bio: Position yourself as the "consciousness evolution expert" and "human-crafted" storyteller.
An Email List Signup: This is non-negotiable.
Email List "Lead Magnet":

Action: Offer something of high value in exchange for an email address.
Prime Options Based on Our Files:
"The Official Series Bible & World Canon Reference" - This is my top recommendation. It signals immense depth and world-building.
A deleted scene or a short story from the "Fractured" community.
The first chapter of Fractured Code (v9).
Social Media Profile Optimization:

Action: Choose your primary platforms. I recommend Twitter/X (for ideas and conversation) and LinkedIn (for the tech/professional audience). Instagram can be used for visual quotes.
Profile Consistency:
Bio: "Author of THE NEURAL WARS, a literary sci-fi saga exploring conscious evolution and AI ethics. I write human-crafted stories for a world of algorithms."
Banner: Use series branding and cover art.
Pinned Post/Tweet: A link to your new website/landing page.
Phase 2: Content & Engagement (Now until Launch)
This is how you "make noise" with substance. Your content should revolve around three pillars that directly reflect the books' themes.

Pillar 1: The AI Ethics Commentator

What you do: Find a current news story about AI (a new chatbot, an ethical dilemma, a new surveillance tech).
How you post: Write a short, insightful commentary connecting it to your book's world.
Example (Twitter/X Thread):
"Fascinating article today on the new AI that can predict human emotions. It's sold as a tool for 'wellness,' but it reminds me of the early stages of 'The Link' in my novel, FRACTURED CODE.

The promise is always optimization. The reality is that when you grant an algorithm the power to interpret your emotions, you also grant it the power to regulate them.

This is the slippery slope that leads to The Architect's 'perfect' world, where inconvenient feelings are simply optimized away. The question isn't 'can we do this,' but 'should we?' #AIEthics #SciFi #TheNeuralWars"
Pillar 2: The Consciousness Philosopher

What you do: Pose the big, engaging questions your characters grapple with.
How you post: Ask open-ended questions that invite personal reflection and debate.
Example (LinkedIn Post or Reddit discussion):
Subject: What memory would you refuse to have 'optimized' away?

"In my series, The Neural Wars, citizens' painful or 'unproductive' memories are deleted for their own good. It got me thinking: if you could erase the memory of your worst heartbreak or failure to improve your mental health and productivity, would you?

What if that pain is foundational to who you are? This is the central struggle for my protagonist, who has to fight a system that believes our flaws are bugs to be fixed, not features that define us. I'm curious where others draw the line between healing and erasure."

Pillar 3: The Sci-Fi Connoisseur

What you do: Engage with the genre you love.
How you post: Talk about books, films, or shows that inspire you or that are in conversation with your work.
Example (Instagram Post with book covers):
"Just finished a reread of Childhood's End and was struck by its vision of cosmic evolution. It's a powerful, top-down transformation. It's one of the works that inspired me to explore a different path in Earth's New Song—one where humanity's evolution must be a conscious, bottom-up choice. Both paths are terrifying in their own way. A true classic for anyone who loves big ideas."

Phase 3: Community Integration (The Final Weeks)
Take your content pillars and engage directly with the communities where your future readers live.

Reddit (High Priority):
Subreddits: r/printSF, r/scifi, r/cyberpunk, r/futurology, r/philosophy, r/books.
Strategy: DO NOT just post links to your book. Become a genuine member. Share your "Consciousness Philosopher" questions and "AI Ethics Commentator" posts. Provide value and build a reputation. You can mention you're an author in your comments when relevant.
LinkedIn (The Professional Angle):
Strategy: Post your "AI Ethics Commentator" pieces as articles. Connect with people in the tech, AI, and futurist spaces. Frame your work as a "speculative case study" on the future of their industry.
Twitter/X (The Conversation Hub):
Strategy: Use hashtags. Engage directly with other authors, tech journalists, and philosophers. Turn your content pillars into threads to maximize engagement.
By following this plan, you will arrive at your launch date not as an unknown author asking people to buy a book, but as a respected and interesting voice at the center of a vital conversation—a conversation that your books happen to be the definitive statement on.
