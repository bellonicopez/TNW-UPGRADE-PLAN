# THE GENESIS KEY: NFT PROJECT LAUNCH CALENDAR (June 22 - July 10, 2025)

**Core Strategy:** Frame this not as an "NFT drop," but as "issuing digital keys to our founding members." The focus is on community, exclusivity, and thematic resonance. All communication should be simple, transparent, and avoid speculative hype.

**Platform Choice:** Solana.
**Public Framing:** "We chose Solana to ensure that claiming your Genesis Key is fast and extremely low-cost, making it accessible to every true fan, not just crypto natives."

### **PHASE 1: THE REVEAL & EDUCATION (June 22 - June 30)**

    > "For the earliest supporters of #TheNeuralWars, the ones who are there from day one... I've been working on a way to give you a permanent, ownable piece of the universe. Not just a thank you, but a key. More details soon. #Community"

    >
    > **What is it?** It's a limited-edition digital collectible that serves as your permanent pass to the inner circle of The Neural Wars. It's a piece of art, a membership card, and a symbol that you were here from the start. It is *not* a speculative asset; its value is in the access it provides.

    >
    > **How do you get one?** These keys cannot be bought from me. They must be earned and claimed. We'll be rewarding newsletter subscribers and those who pre-order the books.
    >
    > I believe in making things accessible, so we're using the Solana blockchain to ensure the cost to claim your Key is incredibly low. This is about community, not crypto complexity."
