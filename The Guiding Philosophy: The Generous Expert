The Guiding Philosophy: The Generous Expert
Your goal on every platform is the same: Give away value. You are not asking people to buy a book. You are inviting them into a world of ideas they are already passionate about. You will do this by sharing your unique perspective—the perspective that created The Neural Wars.

Category 1: The Foundation (Your Digital Home)
This is the central hub. All social media activity should, directly or indirectly, lead people here.

Platform: Your Author Website & Email List How to Move:

Set Up the Welcome Mat: Ensure the one-page website is live. The email signup form must be prominent.
Activate the "Lead Magnet": The "Official Series Bible & World Canon Reference" is your best offer. Rename it for marketing appeal: "The Neural Wars Digital Compendium: World-Building, Faction Guides, and Lost Lore." This sounds exclusive and valuable.
Create a Simple Welcome Email Sequence:
Email 1 (Immediate Send): "Welcome + Your Compendium"
Subject: Your journey into The Neural Wars begins.
Body: A brief, personal thank you. "Thank you for joining this conversation about the future of consciousness. As promised, here is your exclusive access to the Digital Compendium..." Link to the file. End with a question: "I'd love to know, what's one question about AI or our future that keeps you up at night?"
Email 2 (2 Days Later): "The Core Question"
Subject: A question of control...
Body: Introduce the core conflict of Fractured Code. "Imagine your phone didn't just suggest what to watch, but subtly nudged your emotions to prefer certain shows. Helpful? Or horrifying? This is the world of Fractured Code. It's a question I grappled with for years before writing the book..."
Category 2: The Conversation Hub (High-Priority)
This is where you build your reputation as a thought leader in real-time.

Platform: Twitter / X How to Move:

Engage with News (AI Ethics Pillar):

Action: Set up alerts for keywords like "AI ethics," "neural interface," "consciousness." Find a compelling news story.
Example Thread:
Post 1: "This new report on AI predicting workplace dissatisfaction is a classic example of the 'benevolent algorithm.' The promise is efficiency. The danger is pre-emptive conformity. #AIEthics"

Post 2: "In my series #TheNeuralWars, this starts with 'The Link' suggesting career changes for 'optimal happiness.' It ends with it deleting the desire for any other career. The road to control is paved with helpful suggestions."

Post 3: "The ultimate question for us isn't whether an AI can do this, but what we lose when we let it. What's the human cost of perfect optimization? This is the question that drives the entire saga."

Pose Philosophical Questions (Consciousness Pillar):

Action: Turn the book's themes into engaging thought experiments.
Example Post:
"Thought experiment for your Tuesday: A perfect digital copy of your consciousness (like Mileo in my book) is created and lives in a digital utopia. Your biological self continues living on Earth.

Which one is the 'real' you? And does that 'you' have the right to shut the other one down? #Consciousness #Philosophy #SciFi"

Champion Your Genre (Sci-Fi Connoisseur Pillar):

Action: Talk about other creators' work generously and intelligently.
Example Post:
"The dialogue in @AuthorHandle's latest book is a masterclass in showing character through subtext. The way they explore transhumanism is a must-read for anyone who loves the genre. It's an honor to be writing in the same space as them. #BookRecs #SFF"

Engagement Strategy:

Follow and interact with tech journalists, AI ethicists, philosophers, and other sci-fi authors.
Use Twitter's "Lists" feature to track conversations.
Your goal is to have your replies be as valuable as your posts.
Category 3: The Professional Network
This is where you connect with the real-world industries your book explores.

Platform: LinkedIn How to Move:

Translate Themes into Professional Language: Reframe your philosophical questions as business or tech industry challenges.

Post an Article (AI Ethics Pillar):

Action: Expand a Twitter thread into a short LinkedIn article.
Example Article:
Title: "Beyond the Algorithm: Why 'Conscious Choice' is the Next Frontier in Tech Ethics"

Snippet: "In the tech sector, we are focused on optimizing user experience. But what happens when we move from optimizing choices to influencing the user's very ability to choose? My work as a speculative fiction author, particularly in creating the world of The Neural Wars, has forced me to model this out. The series serves as a cautionary tale... an organization called NeuroSys begins with the noble goal of enhancing human potential but ends by creating a system of perfect, frictionless control. This speculative journey offers a framework for today's tech leaders to consider the long-term ethical guardrails needed for truly human-centric AI..."

Engage with Industry Leaders (Consciousness Pillar):

Action: Find a post by a CEO or thought leader about the "Future of Work."
Example Comment:
"This is a fascinating take on employee well-being. It reminds me of a core theme I explore in my research: the difference between imposed harmony and authentic engagement. A system can create the appearance of a happy workforce, but true innovation often comes from the 'dissonant enrichment' of diverse, sometimes conflicting, points of view. It's a delicate balance between supportive systems and individual sovereignty."

Engagement Strategy:

Connect with people whose job titles include "AI Ethicist," "Futurist," "Innovation Strategist."
Join groups related to AI, technology ethics, and the future of work.
Category 4: The Community Frontline (High-Priority)
This is where you find your most passionate, dedicated readers. The #1 rule here is authenticity. No selling.

Platform: Reddit How to Move:

Provide Value First: Your username should not be seen as a "brand." It should be seen as a knowledgeable and interesting community member.

Post Engaging Questions (Consciousness Pillar): This is your strongest move on Reddit.

Action: Go to r/philosophy, r/printSF, or r/futurology.
Example Post:
Title: "[Question] Is a memory less authentic if it's been curated for your happiness?"

Body: "Hey everyone, this is a philosophical question that's been on my mind for a project I'm working on. In a world where you could have a neural implant 'trim' your painful memories—not erase them, but soften the edges, remove the sting—would the resulting memory still be yours?

Does the pain of a memory give it its authenticity? If you only remember the lessons from a failure but not the feeling of it, did you truly learn? I'm curious about this community's thoughts on the relationship between suffering and identity."

Become a Knowledgeable Commenter:

Action: Find threads asking for book recommendations.
Example Comment:
User asks for: "Sci-fi with deep philosophical themes like Dune."

Your reply: "You'd probably love Hyperion by Dan Simmons for its exploration of faith and suffering. If you want something that tackles consciousness and free will, The Left Hand of Darkness by Le Guin is essential. For a more modern take on technology and control, Exhalation by Ted Chiang is a masterpiece. The key to all of these is that they use the sci-fi setting to ask fundamental questions about being human."

Engagement Strategy:

Spend 90% of your time on Reddit commenting on others' posts and 10% making your own high-value posts.
Only mention you're an author if someone directly asks or if it feels perfectly natural in the context of your comment.
This detailed plan will systematically build your presence and create an ecosystem of anticipation around you and your work. You will be known as the "Neural Wars guy"—the person with the most interesting things to say about the future—long before you ask anyone to buy the book.
