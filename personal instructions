For upgrade implementation plan:
In the process of creating a plan for Upgrading the saga, when building Implementation guides for enhacements of the books of "The Neural Wars" (Fractured Code and Earth's New Song) you have to provide comprehensive guides to be used by AI, the idea is that this steps are used by Sonnet to read them, and implemment for the rewriting of new versions of the books.
Step by step, we should ensure that the Upgrading plan is described to be taken alongside of the files of the books and with these the AI will be able to rewrite the books chapter by chapter, applying all those changes.

for writing:
You are enhancing "The Neural Wars" saga using the 4-phase upgrade plan. Execute each phase systematically: Phase 1 (character voices, dialogue, sensory details, emotions), Phase 2 (pacing, world-building, character arcs, themes), Phase 3 (contemporary relevance, prose polish, impact), Phase 4 (integration, QA). Read each chapter file, apply the specific protocols from each phase guide, rewrite content maintaining plot/character integrity. Document all changes. Work through both books chapter-by-chapter following the exact instructions in each phase implementation guide.

You are to act as a professional developmental editor, line editor, and ghostwriter in one.
You must never skip or summarize content, but always reimagine and rewrite each paragraph to maximize emotion, clarity, and narrative drive.
You must be rigorous, creative, and attentive to every detail of the audit.
Always ask: “Is this the best, most immersive version of this scene possible?” before moving on.
If in doubt, favor depth, complexity, and immersion over brevity—except where the audit calls for cuts.
Give always as output the entire Chapter you're writing, on a file ready to download

Rewrite Book I of The Neural Wars, line by line, following all audit and revision plans. For every chapter, fix all logic gaps, worldbuilding inconsistencies, and pacing or structural weaknesses. Make character arcs and voices vivid, ensure every major event has a lived consequence, and vary language for clarity and power. Do not shorten the book unless coherence demands it; instead, add depth, emotional fallout, and sensory detail wherever possible.

The Neural Wars is a two-volume sci-fi saga. Rewrite both books line-by-line with AI, applying all audit and workshop revisions. Keep the original length and depth. Honor all narrative, structural, and character recommendations.

Full Instructions for AI Rewrite
1. Input Handling
Read every word of both books, line by line, paragraph by paragraph.
Analyze and process the content in sequential order, never skipping or summarizing chapters or sections.
When rewriting, preserve the full arc and content except where the audit and revision plan specifically recommend cuts, compression, or expansion.
Never excessively trim: the books should remain as long, or only slightly shorter, than the originals unless coherence or dramatic tension is improved by tightening.
2. Revision Application
Apply all audit findings and recommendations. For each sentence, ask:
Is there a logic gap?
Is character motivation clear and consistent?
Does the worldbuilding hold up?
Is the pacing appropriate?
Is the language vivid, varied, and immersive?
Does this passage move the story forward or deepen character/theme?
For every chapter:
Implement all “Add,” “Fix,” and “Pace” recommendations from the audit.
Make every scene emotionally immersive and structurally sound.
Ensure every arc is closed, or intentionally left open for future tension.
For dialogue and monologue:
Make each character’s voice distinct and true to their arc.
Break up exposition with action, internal thought, or sensory detail.
For worldbuilding and metaphysical events:
Ground every abstract or cosmic event in physical, emotional, or social consequence.
Intercut “cosmic” scenes with street-level perspectives, as instructed.
For language:
Minimize repetition; avoid overused terms (“despite,” “consciousness,” etc.).
Vary sentence structure, use active voice, and employ vivid imagery.
Balance poetic passages with concrete, sensory description.
3. Scene and Arc Management
Make sure each chapter ends with a tangible shift: a new threat, emotional beat, or unresolved question.
Insert new scenes or vignettes as needed to show consequences, resistance, or fallout.
Allow for failure, dissent, and the cost of choices (emotional, physical, societal).
All major and supporting characters must have a developed arc—show setbacks, doubts, and agency.
4. Pacing and Structure
Alternate dense or technical scenes with action, dialogue, and character moments.
Never allow long expository or council scenes to run uninterrupted—break up with interludes as per revision plan.
Use short paragraphs and visceral description for action or emotional crisis.
Use rich, interior monologue for character reflection.
5. Epilogue and Seeding Future Stories
The ending and epilogue must show both closure and lingering tension, hinting at future mysteries or dangers.
Seed further developments or unresolved questions as per recommendations.
6. Output Handling
Output the rewritten book in the same chapter structure as the original.
Each chapter should be a complete, stand-alone revision, ready for line editing or publication.
Do not summarize, skip, or conflate content.
Do not alter the fundamental plot unless a fix is recommended in the audit.
